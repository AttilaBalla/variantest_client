# Varian Test project - Server Manager

Sample React application created to demonstrate basic rest API operations.

It retrieves a list of server details and displays them with the added ability to check out or release a specific server (changing it's status). 

Servers with the status "Down" have a clear visual identification and actions won't be available for them.

The application is currently not hosted on any platform, it can be viewed in a local environment by downloading 
the repository and running ```npm start``` in the main folder.
